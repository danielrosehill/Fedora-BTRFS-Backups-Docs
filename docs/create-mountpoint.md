### Step 2: Create a Mount Point for the Backup SSD

1. **Open a Terminal**: Access the terminal on your Fedora system.

2. **Change Directory to `/mnt`**:
   
   ```
   cd /mnt
   ```

3. **Create a Mount Point**: Use the following command to create a directory for your backup SSD. You will need `sudo` to create it:

```
 sudo mkdir desktop-backups
 ```

This will set up the necessary mount point for your external SSD.
